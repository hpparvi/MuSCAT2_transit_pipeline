README for the light curves and tools for MuSCAT/MuSCAT2
Written by Akihiko Fukui, July 3, 2017


(1) File name of the light curves 

  Each file is named by the following format:

  lc[type(f or m)]_[instrument]_[band]_[target name]_[date]_t[target star ID]_c[comparison star IDs]_r[range of aperture radii].bjd.dat

  e.g., 
    lcf_msct_g_hatp12_170124_t1_c23_r28-36.bjd.dat

    meanings:
      type: f 
            (f: flux scale, m: magnitude scale)
      instrument: msct
      band: g
      target name: hatp12
      date: 170124
      target star ID: 1
      comparison star IDs: 2 & 3
      range of aperture radii: 28--36 (pix)

  * ".bjd." means that all time stamps were converted into BJD(TDB).


(2) Format of type "f" (flux scale) light curves 

  column1: Time (BJD_TDB-2450000)
  column2: Airmass
  column3: Mean sky background for all stars (ADU/pix)
  column4: Relative stellar displacement in X direction (pixel)
  column5: Relative stellar displacement in Y direction (pixel)
  column6: Mean FWHM of stellar PSFs (pixel)
  column7: Peak count of the brightest star (ADU)
  column8: Frame name
  column(9+i*2): Relative, normalized (so that the median is equal to unity), and un-detrended flux for the given aperture radius 
  column(9+i*2+1): Theoretical 1-sigma uncertainty of the relative flux for the given aperture radius (including photon noises of the stars, sky background noises, scintillation noises, readout noises, and dark noises) 


(3) Format of type "m" (magnitude scale) light curves
  
  column1: Time (BJD_TDB-2450000)
  column2: Airmass
  column3: Mean sky background for all stars ( mag = -2.5*log(sky(ADU)) )
  column4: Relative stellar displacement in X direction (pixel)
  column5: Relative stellar displacement in Y direction (pixel)
  column6: Mean FWHM of stellar PSFs (pixel)
  column7: Peak count of the brightest star ( mag = -2.5*log(peak(ADU)) )
  column8: Frame name
  column(9+i*3): raw magnitude of the target star for the given aperture radius, calculated by mag_t = -2.5*log(raw flux(ADU)) 
  column(9+i*3+1): raw magnitude of the ensemble of comparison stars for the given aperture radius, calculated by mag_c = -2.5*log(raw flux(ADU)) 
  column(9+i*3+2): Theoretical 1-sigma uncertainty of the magnitude difference between the target and compariosn stars for the given aperture radius, calculated by mag_t-c_err = sqrt(mag_t_err^2 + mag_c_err^2)
 
  The "raw magnitude" light curve can be used to partly correct the second-order extinction effect by fiting the coefficient of mag_c (without using approximated airmass values), which gives at least as well as, and in most cases better than, the conventional airmass correction to a relative, already-devided light curve. See Equation (8) of Fukui et al. 2016b:
    http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AJ....152..171F

  This method is encouraged to be used as it is more physically motivated than the conventional airmass correction.


(4) Useful tools to remove outliers

  - list_outliers.pl
    A tool to calculate outliers by searching for deviations from smoothing data (moving average) of any given input data, and list their frame names.
    Type "perl list_outliers.pl" to see the usage.

  - remove_outliers.pl
    A tool to remove outliers from an input light curve.
    Type "perl remove_outliers.pl" to see the usage.


(5) A tool to make raw light curves for the "multi-band approach"

  - mklc_multiband.pl

    This tool will create raw mag-scale light curves of target star along with multi-band, raw mag-scale light curves of comparison stars. These light curves can be used to apply the "multi-band approach" to correcting the second-order extinction, described in Section 4.3.2 in Fukui et al. 2016, AJ, 152, 171: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AJ....152..171F
    Type "perl mklc_multiband.pl" to see the usage.
